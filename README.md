<h1>Pop-Up Penguin Game / Find the Yeti</h1>

<p>I just discovered <a href="https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/pop_up_penguins/">Coder Projects</a> which has a couple cute and fun things to build using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://amytangcodes.com/penguins/">Penguin game</a> is a very easy and simple project where you learn to use some CSS pseudo-classes, hover and active effects, and cursor.</p>

<p>Hover over each snow mound to see what happens and then click on them to find all the penguins.  Don't disturb the yeti!</p>
